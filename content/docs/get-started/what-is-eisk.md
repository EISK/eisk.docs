# What is EISK?

EISK provides a solid guideline for building enterprise level projects, by utilizing new asp.net and sql server features, as well as latest best coding practices. It includes but not limited to:

* Project templates ([VSIX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AshrafulAlam.EmployeeInfoStarterKitEISK-MVC), [dotnet new cli](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Eisk.WebApi/))
* [Utility libraries](https://github.com/EISK/eisk.core) (to facilitate writing minimal code)
* [Use case samples](https://github.com/EISK/eisk.webapi) demonstrating best practices
* Architecture and development guideline [documentations](https://eisk.github.io/eisk.webapi/docs/application-development/handson-walkthrough-create-service-api.html).

### Release History

Since its first release, by April 2008, this open source project gained a huge popularity in the developer community and had 250K+ combined downloads.

This starter kit is honored to be placed at the official ASP.NET site, along with other Asp.Net starter kits, which all are being considered as the “Best” Asp.Net coding standards, recommended by Microsoft. In a weekly show of Microsoft’s [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/This+Week+On+Channel+9/TWC9-New-Mix-Sessions-announced-dissecting-IE9-Performance-Azure-Toolkit-for-WP7), it has been appreciated by Microsoft Director Dan Fernandez.

### Architectural Objective

There is no universal architecture which can be considered as the best for all sorts of applications around the world. Based on requirements, constraints, environment, application architecture can differ from one to another. Trade-off factors are one of the important considerations while deciding a particular architectural solution.

Employee Info Starter Kit is highly influenced by the concept ‘Pareto Principle’ or 80-20 rule, where it is targeted to enable a web developer to gain 80% productivity with 20% of effort with respect to learning curve and production.

“Productivity” as the architectural objective typically also includes other trade-off factors as well as, such as testability, flexibility, performance etc. Fortunately Microsoft's latest .NET Framework Core and Visual Studio includes lots of great features that have been implemented cleverly in this project to reduce these trade-off factors in the minimum level.

### Why EISK is Not a Framework?

Application frameworks are great for productivity, some of which are unavoidable in this modern age. However relying too many frameworks may overkill a project, as frameworks are typically designed to serve wide range of different usage and are less customizable or editable. 

On the other hand, having implementation patterns can be useful for developers, as it enables them to adjust application on demand. 

EISK provides hundreds of “connected” snippets with optimized solution and implementation patterns to demonstrate problem solutions in actual production environment. 

### Why EISK is Different?

Software development is one of the rapid growing industries around the globe, where the technology is being updated very frequently to adapt greater challenges over time. There are literally thousands of community web sites, blogs and forums that are dedicated to provide support to adapt new technologies. 

While some are great to enable learning new technologies quickly, in most cases they are either too “simple and brief” to be used in real world scenarios or too “complex and detailed” which are typically focused to achieve a product goal (such as CMS, e-Commerce etc) from "end user" perspective and have a long duration learning curve with respect to the corresponding technology. 

EISK, as a web project, is basically "developer" oriented which actually considers a hybrid approach as “simple and detailed”, where a simple domain has been considered to intentionally illustrate most of the architectural and implementation challenges faced by web application developers so that anyone can dive into deep into the corresponding new technology or concept quickly.
