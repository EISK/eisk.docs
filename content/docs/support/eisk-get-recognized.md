# Get Recognized

EISK is an open source project that provides ASP.NET project templates that are intended to address different types of real world challenges faced by web application developers when performing common data operations (a.k.a CRUD).

Using a single entity ‘Employee’, it illustrates how to utilize most of the greatest and successful platforms, frameworks and technologies,  to enable web developers to learn and build manageable and high performance web applications with rich user experience effectively and quickly.

Since its first release, this open source project gained a huge popularity in the developer community and had 200K+ combined downloads. This starter kit is honored to be placed at the official ASP.NET site, along with other asp.net starter kits, which all are being considered as the “best” ASP.NET coding standards, recommended by Microsoft. EISK is showcased in Microsoft’s Channel 9’s Weekly Show, as well.

Check out an online demo.
